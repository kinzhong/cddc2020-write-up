Apparently, the time given can be changed to Unix Timestamp (Epoch)
The hex epoch can then be translated to ascii.
Using the first datetime, CD�� was obtained. However, CDDC was expected.
As the hex epoch is the number of seconds since 1/1/1970, 
this meant that the smaller variables such as the day or hour might be different. 
Based on that observation, we can determine that perhaps the time given may not be in UTC but in GMT +8.
Changing the hex epoch to UTC fixed the issue.
CDDC_{02_ItI_3Ns_rev_ooT_taL_0Te_ksA_ahW_1Tt_1em_5It }!! was obtained. 

However, it still did not observe the general format of the flags.
By reversing each 4 characters: CDDC ==> CDDC  , _{02 ==> 20{_ 
The flag is obtained.
FLAG: CDDC20{_ItI_sN3_ver_Too_Lat_eT0_Ask_Wha_tT1_me1_tI5_!!}
