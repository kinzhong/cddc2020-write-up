# Write-ups
Each text file has information about the challenge and the files required. Short write-ups and the flag can be found in the text files as well. The write-ups contains the methods I used to reach the flag. This include observations and tools used. Please take note that some challenge files were flagged by Windows Defender and MalwareBytes as malicious and thus, should be analysed in a sandbox environment.
