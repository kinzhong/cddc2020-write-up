Analysing the file using Ghidra and starting from function main, we can follow the flow of instructions. 
The function check is particularly suspicious, as it contains 0x43444443 in a variable. From experience in the CTF, this is part of the FLAG where 0x43444443 = CDDC (ascii)

  local_37 = 0x43444443;
  local_33 = 0x457b3032;
  local_2f = 0x567a7135;
  local_2b = 0x7a347036;
  local_27 = 0x6b653b5a;
  local_23 = 0x7d73;
  local_21 = 0;

Playing around with the hex, we can obtain the general structure of the flag as shown below. This was done by swapping the endian and converting to ascii.
CDDC20{E5qzV6p4zZ;ek..s}

However, this is not the flag. Analysing more of the code reveals that the flag is modified as seen below (after renaming and changing hex values for clarity). 

    counter = 0;
    while (counter < 14) {
      *(&local_33 + counter + 3) = counter ^ *(&local_33 + counter + 3);
      counter = counter + 1;
    }
	
To execute this part, it would require patching many jump statements. Therefore, a simpler solution would be to understand the code, recreate it and run it with the obtained data.
From the code we can see that CDDC20{ are skipped as it starts from local_33 and the 3 is added to the counter. 
As seen, the binary XOR operation ^ is used to modify the flag.

Recreated code below: 
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char s[] = "CDDC20{E5qzV6p4zZ;ek..s}";

    int counter = 0;
    while (counter < 14) {
        
        s[counter+7] = counter ^ s[counter + 7];
        counter ++;
    }

    printf("%s", s);
    return 0;
}

Output: CDDC20{E4syR3v3rS1ng#.s}                                                                                                                                                           

However, this is not the flag. By observing the number of loops, we can see there might only be 14 characters in the flag rather than 16.
Removing the .. in char s[] = "CDDC20{E5qzV6p4zZ;ek..s}", gives us the correct flag.

FLAG: CDDC20{E4syR3v3rS1ng~}
