DESCRIPTION
We reailsed that Unduplicitous Corp uses this code for their assets tagging. But we can't figure out how exactly to decode it, hmm.

MD5("barcode.gif"): df90bf8d0533e5757ea1fede8743adbc

ATTACHED FILES
barcode.gif

Reverse searching the image lets us know that the image is a maxicode QR
Comparing the normal maxicode QRs against the given barcode.gif,
we can see that it has been manipulated.
This is also supported after running exiftool on it where it states "Created with GIMP"
Hence, we just needed to invert the colors and read the QR code
