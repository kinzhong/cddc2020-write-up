DESCRIPTION
As part of our resistance fighters' training program, we need to arm ourselves with academic knowledge. By the graces of my kind senior, he passed me some recommended reading materials.

One pdf seems to be annotated, while the other isn't. I wonder what is the difference between the two.. Can you spot it?

Compare the 2 pdf, the annotated PDF has special characters. 
Using an online pdf comparator, the flag is found in the differences. 
Sorry, too lazy to repeat doing it.
