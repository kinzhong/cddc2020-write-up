DESCRIPTION
We found a suspicous WAV file in Unduplicitous Corp's server. Hmm.

Note:
The extracted data does not include the flag format "CDDC20{}". Add in the flag format "CDDC20{}" during submission, and ensure that the flag string is fully in uppercase, i.e. CDDC20{SAMPLEFLAG}.

MD5("original.wav"): f3b55bc341bd8039ffc125cee163b1dc
MD5("suspicious.wav"): c3844b40b7d25ca414020f60f826512a

ATTACHED FILES
original.wav
suspicious.wav


Originally during the session, by comparing the hex values of the files, it was observed that there were many slight differences in the hex values (+1/-1 of the hex values).
For example, in the original, the hex was 00 and in the suspicious it was 01. 
Therefore, i suspected that the flag was hidden through these differences where +1 was a binary value of 1 and -1 was a binary of 0 (or vice versa)
However, this was not the case.

Getting some hints from a friend after the CTF was over, we should observe the files in audacity. 
To obtain the flag, we have to invert the suspicious.wav and mix and render it with the original.
This will yield a wav file which looks like morse code and translating it will obtain the flag.
Morse Code: __ ___ ._. ... . ._.. ... _...
FLAG: MORSELSB

Please note that as the CTF was over, the obtained flag above is not verified.
